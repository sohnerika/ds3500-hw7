PREPARED REMARKS

Suhasini Chandramouli:
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q4 fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.

Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

Timothy Donald Cook:
Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year over year.

We set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the U.K., Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record.

This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligent system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant.

Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple Innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with private cloud compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users with systemwide writing tools, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages.

We look forward to additional intelligence features in December with even more powerful writing tools, a new visual intelligence experience, ChatGPT integration, and localized English in several countries, including the U.K., Australia, and Canada.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

iPhone:
iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16 powered by A18 is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera and the addition of the action button and camera control. iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system, studio-quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life.

Mac:
Revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple silicon to Mac: M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows and ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI. We introduced iMac, MacBook Air with double the starting memory, MacBook Pro, and the incredible mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac.

iPad:
Revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year over year. Recently, we introduced the newest iPad mini featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers, while creators are pushing the boundaries with the M4-powered iPad Pro.

With AirPods 4, we've broken new ground in comfort and design. We unveiled revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These became available this week, and customers are calling the experience life-changing.

LEADERSHIP TRANSITION

Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. I want to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO.
